# Niri-Setup


This Repository is more or less just a Backup for my Dotfiles for Niri and CachyOS (even though most of the stuff should work fine in Other Distros).
Its mostly themed after the "Dracula" theme.


# Packages you should install:

-qt6ct (Darkmode von KDE Plamsa Apps)

-gvfs-smb (SMB in Nautilus)

-blueman (Bluetooth Manager)

-waybar-module-pacman-updates-git (Updates in Tray)


# Things you maybe need:

-thunar (Explorer alternativ with Darkmode)

-pavucontrol-qt (dark Audiocontroller)

-gnome-shell (resolve problems with Discord Streams)

-deepin calendar (Calendar)

-librewolf-bin (secure Browser)

# Reasons to go inside the Niri or Waybar config:

Niri:


-change Keybinds

-setup your Monitor (Check with "niri msg outputs")

-dont use Librewolf or Thunar


Waybar:


-dont use pavucontrol-qt
