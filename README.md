# Niri-Setup


This Repository is more or less just a Backup for my Dotfiles for Niri and CachyOS (even though most of the stuff should work fine in Other Distros)

Its mostly themed after the "Dracula" theme


# Packages you should install:

-qt6ct (for darkmode von KDE Plamsa apps)

-gvfs-smb (to use smb in Nautilus)

-blueman (for Bluetooth)

-waybar-module-pacman-updates-git (to show updates in the Waybar tray)

-deepin calendar (as calendar)


# Things you maybe need:


-thunar (as Explorer if you dont like Nautilus or just want darkmode)

-pavucontrol-qt (for a dark audiocontroller)

-gnome-shell (if you have problems with Discord streams)
